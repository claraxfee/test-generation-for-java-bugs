When one eventstate is changed, not every state is brought to the same point as the updated state. 
This caused a failed assertion.

failed test 
@Test
    public void testIssue942() {
        List<Pair<Object,Double>> list = new ArrayList<Pair<Object, Double>>();
        list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(0)));
        list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(1)));
        Assert.assertEquals(1, new DiscreteDistribution<Object>(list).sample(1).length);
    }
    
 Array.newInstance(object, size) creates an array of type object and length size.
 This is used to get samples of a distribution. The error occurs when the distribution is of 
 parent class T, and the 0th element which is given to newInstance is of subclass T1. The array
 will be of type T1, but other elements copied to the sample may not be of type T1, only of T. 
 This causes an exception.
